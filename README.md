## 🛠️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18.x or higher
- **pnpm** (preferred) or npm/yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SafeVault/vestroll-frontend.git
   cd vestroll
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. Configure Environment:
   Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and add necessary variables (see `.env.example`).

4. Start development server:
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```
   The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Database Setup

1. Ensure PostgreSQL is running and accessible via your `DATABASE_URL`.

2. Push the database schema:
   ```bash
   pnpm db:push
   ```
   Alternatively, to generate migrations first:
   ```bash
   pnpm db:generate
   pnpm db:migrate
   ```

3. (Optional) View your database with Drizzle Studio:
   ```bash
   pnpm db:studio
   ```

### Available Scripts

- `pnpm dev`: Runs the app in development mode with Turbopack.
- `pnpm build`: Builds the application for production.
- `pnpm start`: Starts the production server.
- `pnpm lint`: Runs ESLint for code quality checks.
- `pnpm test`: Runs unit tests with Vitest.
- `pnpm test:watch`: Runs tests in watch mode.
- `pnpm db:generate`: Generate Drizzle migrations.
- `pnpm db:migrate`: Apply pending migrations.
- `pnpm db:push`: Sync schema with the database.
- `pnpm db:studio`: Open Drizzle Studio for database inspection.

---

## 🛡️ Coding Standards

- **TypeScript**: Strict typing is required. Avoid `any`.
- **Components**: Follow the `features/` vs `shared/` modular structure.
- **State**: Use Redux for UI-heavy state (modals, global app state) and Zustand for lightweight store needs.
- **Styling**: Use the `cn()` utility for conditional Tailwind classes.
